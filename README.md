# nanoBot
A little bot program I wrote for bitmonky.com members to dowload and use on their pc/laptop to do small tasks that earn bitMonky tokens.  I have
uplaoded the backend so anyone can modify it and make their own AI agent scraper.

UPDATE  - Originaly it paid workers in a token called bitMonky.  But you can incentivise worker bots any way you like.
Or just run a few bots of your own.  

The more diverse the bot network IPs are the less chance of your jobs getting rejected as a bot by the site you are trying to scrape.

** Requires nodejs 12.0 or higher
